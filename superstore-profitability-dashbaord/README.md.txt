# Superstore Profitability Dashboard

An executive-style, interactive profitability dashboard built using a Superstore-style dataset.
This project focuses on identifying profit drivers, loss-making areas, and actionable business insights
using the available data (no order or ship dates).

## 🔗 Live Dashboard
https://github.com/Adedoyin214/superstore-profitability-dashboard.git


## 📊 Business Questions Answered
- Which categories and sub-categories drive profit or losses?
- How do discounts affect profitability?
- Which states are underperforming?
- Which customer segments are most profitable?

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Discounting is the strongest profit lever**  
  Orders with discounts above 20% are consistently loss-making.

- **Furniture underperforms**  
  Especially Tables and Bookcases, which contribute the largest losses.

- **Losses are geographically concentrated**  
  Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois show persistent negative profit.

- **Segment performance varies**  
  Home Office customers generate higher margins than Consumer.

## 🧠 Recommendations
- Enforce discount guardrails (≤20%)
- Reprice or rationalize loss-making Furniture sub-categories
- Audit discount strategy in loss-heavy states
- Shift Consumer promotions toward bundles instead of deep discounts

## 🛠 Tools Used
